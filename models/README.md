# Endocytosis Models

All models were written in the rule-based language for multi-level modeling: ML-Rules ([Helms et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1145/2998499)).

The models correspond to:
* M1_General.mlrj: **Basic internalization model of WNT/LRP6 (M1)**
* M2_Microdomains.mlrj: **Compartment-based model of LRP6 endocytosis (M2)**
* M3_Wnt.mlrj: **Coupled compartment-based internalization model with intracellular WNT model (M3)**
* M4_Dkk.mlrj: **Combined model with Dkk1-mediated shift of the internalization pathway (M4)**
