# Reference and explanation of wet-lab data

The data found in the files were taken from literature (see below) and are used as reference data in our publication (red points in plots).

## DKK_Endocytosis.csv

**What:** The data has been taken from Fig. 3C of [16] by using the pixel coordinates of the mean and s.e.m. Regarding the data: "The amounts of cell-surface or total LRP6 were quantified using NIH image software. The results are shown as the ratio of cell-surface LRP6 to total LRP6. Values at zero time were set to 100%. The results shown are means ± s.e.m. from four independent experiments." [16]

## RawDataSurfaceLRP6.csv

**What:** The data has been taken from Fig. 1C of [11] by using the pixel coordinates of the mean and s.e. Regarding the data: "The amounts of cell surface or total LRP6 were analyzed with NIH images. The results are expressed as the ratio of cell surface LRP6 to total LRP6 (lower panel). Values at zero times are set to 100%. The results shown are means ± SE from three independent experiments."
